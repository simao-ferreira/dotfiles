All purpose unix repository

## Summary
After a decade in-and-out of linux, having trouble with Ubuntu and Mint, I decided to move definitively to linux.

Having endured some issues on Ubuntu, my most usual setups are based in mate, cinnamon or gnome.
This time around the flavor is Arch based Manjaro. During testing, I stumbled upon i3, and fell in love.

Having tried already several versions like mate, cinnamon, unity, gnome or budgie, the most recent playground is i3, but to much changes between them, and sometimes it's easy to forget how to solve some issue. Even more on i3.
This repo's purpose is to record findings, instructions or links pertaining configurations, issues or any simple instructions that are relevant to my daily usage, and avoid hours of research for some small detail.
