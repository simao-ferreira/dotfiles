# Summary
I have a new PC.
So while considering my new setup, I realised how much I had grown tired of ubuntu shenanigans and constant uncertanty. 
When researching for alternatives I felt impressed by two things:
* Manjaro
* i3

I have already tryed a bit of both, felt some issues regarding both, and on top i realised my workflow will need to be adpated. 

I am already writing this from my Manjaro Gnome setup. But i3 became a different beast all together.

Still, I have no clue to how improve, manage and be efficient with this tool.

# Purpose
This will report my findings and my pains, but hopefully also some configurations and growth.

# Gnome
Add gtk.css to /.config/gtk-3.0 the gtk.css file
