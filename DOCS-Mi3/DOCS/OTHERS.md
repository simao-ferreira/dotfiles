### Oblogout
Oblogout is a configurable logout script with graphical UI, that allows to cancel, restart, shutdown and lock.
* Rofi script is used instead.

Feh-blur allows you to focus your attention on the application in use by applying blur to the desktop background.
* Not interesting since using i3 with gaps, it's more adequate to open-box layouts.
