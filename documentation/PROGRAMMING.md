## Java
It is possible to have more then one jdk installed at the same time, tools like Intellij allows to choose in the settings which version to build and run with. But other tools make it necessary to change the system default.

To change it Mi3 provides a [script](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/java), run `archlinux-java status` to get the installed versions and then `sudo archlinux-java set <jre-version>` to set the desired version.
