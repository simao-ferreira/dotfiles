## File Manager
Mi3 file managers are ranger, a terminal file manager, and `pcmanfm`, a more typical graphical interface.

Ranger is written in python, by default presents three columns, the middle one is the *working* panel, to move between them you can use arrows or other defined keys. The most right column allows previews for files and images. It includes capabilities *vim-like* with keybindings and bookmarks. It is also possible to use external scripts. 

Ranger uses the default color scheme defined at `.Xresources`, but a specific theme can be set, adding `set colorscheme <scheme>`, original setup contains `deafult`, `jungle`, `snow` and `solarized` themes.
 
Adding to Ranger there is also pcmanfm, a standard linux integrated File Manager. Very similar to the gnome version.

## Menu
By default there dmenu, a fast and light menu for the X system, it's presented as a bar, usually on the top, where it reads text from STDIN and creates a menu with options related to the user input, the navigation is done by moving through options using the arrow keys (or other defined for the same purpose) and uses the `dmenu_run` wrapper for application launcher.

To run it from the console run`dmenu_run`, if a top bar exists, like `i3status` or `polybar`, `dmenu` will appear on top of it.

However there are other options with more "eye-candy", one of those is rofi.

Install rofi, a "better dmenu" through pamac or `sudo pacman -S rofi`.

After installing edit the `.i3/config` file, comment the line about dmenu and add:
`bindsym $mod+d exec rofi -lines 12 -padding 18 -width 60 -location 0 -show drun -sidebar-mode -columns 3`
* This command works for the initial setup, some changes need to be made according to settings, for example using a rasi theme.

This will replace the usual call to `dmenu`. However `dmenu` still works if another keybinding is provided. That is a important setting case something breaks on installation.
To move between types like windows, ssh or drun press `shift+<arrows>` while on rofi.

Also it is possible to configure a faster keybinding like the one used on WindowsOS. For moving between open windows: 
`bindsym $mod+Tab exec rofi -lines 12 -padding 18 -width 60 -location 0 -show window -sidebar-mode -columns 3`

Rofi can be configured in several different ways.
`rofi -help` will give you the current configuration and location.
By adding `~/.config/rofi/config.` you can specify the look and feel of rofi window.

Another option, more powerful but easier to update is using rasi configurations, this allows to define a theme, with a color pattern and different settings, as an example is possible to define looks for specified modules.
Rasi themes work in addition to the config file.
This allows visuals more complex, but defined with a more modular approach, easier to manage and change, also make it easy to integrate with scripts. 
To find themes got to [rasi-themes](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi-themes), this repo has a few to use or as example.

Mi3 also has a small categorized menu cascade style `morc_menu`, called with `mod+z`, that will open a simple menu up top, displaying categories with applications. Good emergency option.

## Layout
Saving workspace [layout](https://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html) can be done through the use of `i3-save-tree`, this can be used to print to stdout a JSON containing a data structure for the selected layout. 
This JSON has a dump of the workspace content, without workspace properties and with all relevant windows data commented. It is necessary to uncomment window data that has relevance and ass a workspace layout wrap.

Add `exec --no-startup-id "i3-msg 'workspace 8; append_layout ~/.i3/ws8.json'"` to i3 config for lock the workspace layout, however the apps need to be initiated at startup as well if necessary to be working from the beginning.

* The error `Can't locate AnyEvent/I3.pm` can be solved by installing `perl-anyevent-i3` from manjaro repos.
