# Bspwm

## Monitors (extract)
Bspwm manages monitor surprisingly well without specifically using `xrandr`, however I cannot create more then 1 desktop for monitor, does not recognize the monitors *name*.

In order to enable command line interface into `randr` and manage rotation and resize, install
```
# pacman -Ss xorg-xrandr
```

To install a GUI it is possible to install `arandr`.

# Sxhkd
