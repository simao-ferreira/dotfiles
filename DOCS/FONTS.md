#Fonts

Fonts are difficult.

To understand if a font has been installed run `fc-list`, maybe `grep` will help narrowing it down.

Run `fc-cache` to reload fonts.

Fist attempt to change font > same result as color > changes have to be manually input in `.Xresources`, `URxvt terminal`, `polybar`, `ranger`, `.i3/config`, `gedit`, `chromium`, `dunst` and `rofi`
